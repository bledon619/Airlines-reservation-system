# Airlines-reservation-system


The project is built using c++ uses oops concepts: Inheritance,encapsulation,abstraction(abstract class and pure virtual function):

This lets you book the ticket for various airlines from the portal of my airlines;
Fetches details -> registers the customer-> calculate the charges according to the selection and destination location.

Thank you!!
